Here, we characterize the differential impact of p53(null), as well as p53 hotspot mutations p53-R712H (R175H in humans) and p53-R245W (R248W in humans) on BRAF(V600E) lung tumorigenesis. We observed a disparate effect of p53-R172H on BRAF(V600E)-driven lung tumorigenesis that was not observed when p53 is deleted, such as enhanced tumor size and decreased survival. Our findings highlight functional differences in mutant-p53 biology, as well as the importance and the utility of clinically relevant mutant-p53 mouse models.
