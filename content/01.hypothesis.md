## Abstract {.page_break_before}

^TP53^ missense BRAF^V600E^ mutations both frequently occur in lung adenocarcinoma. While genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of lung adenocarcinoma are invaluable for understanding the initiation, progression, and response to therapeutics, little is known about how different hotspot point mutations in p53 affect disease progression and therapeutic responses. To this end, we use GEMMs, tumor-derived cell lines, and human lung cancer cell lines to test how  murine homologues of p53 hotspot mutants R172H and R245W compare to p53-deletion. We find that conformation mutation p53^R172H^ drives more aggressive lung adenocarcinomas and dedifferentiation. We also observe p53^R172H^ and p53^R245W^ accumulation in only high-grade tumors that have activated ARF expression. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate enhanced resistance to BRAF+MEK blockade with p53^R172H^ and p53^R245W^, a common treatment regimen for BRAF^V600E^ mutant patients. Mechanistically, mutant-p53 alters the transcriptome of cancer cells and enhances entry into the cell cycle.
